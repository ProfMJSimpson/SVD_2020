# SVD_2020
Finite difference codes for the Fisher-Stefan model in n-dimensions
This MATLAB file takes the discretized equations from Simpson (2020) and integrates forward in time using a standard central difference scheme, 
the resulting nonlinear systems of algebraic equations are solved using Newton-Raphson iteration and the resulting linear systems are solving
using the Thomas algorithm.
